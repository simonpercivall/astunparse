An AST unparser for Python.

This is a factored out version of ``unparse`` found in the Python
source distribution; under Demo/parser in Python 2 and under Tools/parser
in Python 3.

Basic example::

    import inspect
    import ast
    import astunparse

    # get back the source code
    astunparse.unparse(ast.parse(inspect.getsource(ast)))

    # get a pretty-printed dump of the AST
    astunparse.dump(ast.parse(inspect.getsource(ast)))


This library is single-source compatible with Python 2.6 through Python 3.8. It
is authored by the Python core developers; I have simply merged the Python 2.7
and the Python 3.8 source and test suites, and added a wrapper. This factoring
out is to provide a library implementation that supports both versions.

Added to this is a pretty-printing ``dump`` utility function.

The test suite both runs specific tests and also roundtrips much of the
standard library.

Extensions and Alternatives
---------------------------

Similar projects include:

    * codegen_
    * astor_
    * astmonkey_
    * astprint_

None of these roundtrip much of the standard library and fail several of the basic
tests in the ``test_unparse`` test suite.

This library uses mature and core maintained code instead of trying to patch
existing libraries. The ``unparse`` and the ``test_unparse`` modules
are under the PSF license.

Extensions include:

    * typed-astunparse: extends astunparse to support type annotations.

* Documentation: http://astunparse.rtfd.org.

Features
--------

* unparses Python AST.
* pretty-prints AST.
